# gravsim
A classical (for now) n-body gravitational simulation written in Python and visualized using matplotlib. It uses Runge-Kutta 4 numerical integration and tracks drift in total energy of the systemn over time.

The Hohmann transfer orbit code computes the instanteneous burn velocities for a 2-burn transfer between two orbits, and uses matplotlib to visualize the resulting path.
